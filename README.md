# reversible-meme

Over recent years, extraordinary work has been done in
conditional natural language generation. However, an area
that is relatively unexplored is computational humor. In the
internet age, memes have become the primary form of media to communicate humor. In this project we aim to create
joint visual semantic embedding space that can represent
the visual contents of a meme template composed with the
emotion and tone it conveys. These embeddings can then be
further used to generate humorous captions given a meme
template.
